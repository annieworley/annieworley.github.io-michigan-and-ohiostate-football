In the 2021 and 2022 games Ohio State had a significant number compared to Michigan.\nMichigan across the nine games they lost straight to Ohio State, had at least one turnover every game. The past three games Michigan cleaned up their play and only had one turn over in total. In those nine loses Michigan lost the turn over battle every game except 2013.\nHow many turnovers did Michigan and Ohio State each have across their past 11 match ups?\n\n\nCode\nturnovers &lt;- read_csv(\"turnovers.csv\") \n\n\nRows: 22 Columns: 3\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (1): School\ndbl (2): Year, Turnovers\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nCode\n#| messasge: FALSE\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=turnovers, aes(x=Year, weight=Turnovers, fill=School)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  facet_wrap(~School) +\nscale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Michigan\" = \"#00274C\", \"Ohio State\" = \"#BB0000\")) + theme_minimal() +\nlabs(\n    x=\"Year of Game\", \n    y=\"Total Number of Turnovers\", \n    title=\"Michigan has cleaned up their play and reduced the number of turnovers\", \n    subtitle=\"Michigan made the changes to be able to help them dominate\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Annie Worley\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\", color = \"black\"), \n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\" )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s clear Ohio State had too many turnovers in 2022 and 2023 and affected the outcome.\nThe data shows Michigan improved their performance in key areas to be able to dominate a good team the last three years. Going forward it may be hard for Michigan to keep up with these statistics due to changes within the coaching staff and key players."
